/**
 * DataStoreCore is an interface for a simplified subset of the functionality of
 * {@link DataStore}, to be used in conjunction with {@link CachingStoreWrapper}. This allows
 * developers of custom DataStore implementations to avoid repeating logic that would
 * commonly be needed in any such implementation, such as caching. Instead, they can implement
 * only DataStoreCore and then create a CachingStoreWrapper.
 * <p>
 * Note that these methods do not take any generic type parameters; all storeable entities are
 * treated as implementations of the {@link VersionedData} interface, and a {@link VersionedDataKind}
 * instance is used to specify what kind of entity is being referenced. If entities will be
 * marshaled and unmarshaled, this must be done by reflection, using the type specified by
 * {@link VersionedDataKind#getItemClass()}; the methods in {@link DataStoreHelpers} may be
 * useful for this.
